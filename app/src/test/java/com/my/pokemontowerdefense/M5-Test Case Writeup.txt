M5 Test Case Writeup
Case #1: M5 - Test enemy HP decreases
        We have three enemies (Rattata, Haunter, and Grimer). The reduceHP method is called on each enemy. Then, we use assertEquals to check if the enemy has the right HP. For example, rattata is tested to have an HP of 95 after reduceHP is called.

Case #2: M5 - Test enemy gameplay distinction
        We create three variables: one for each enemy (difficulty is set as hard but it could be any because we are just testing the enemy object). We use assertNotEquals() to check that the enemies' HP values are not equal to each other (rattata/haunter, haunter/grimer, grimer/rattata).

Case #3: M5 - Test award money differs
        We have three enemies (Rattata, Haunter, and Grimer). We use assertNotEquals to check if the enemies have differing award money amounts.

Case #4: M5 - Test tower behavior differs
        We have three towers (charmander, squirtle, and bulbasaur). We use assertNotEquals() to verify that the towers have differing cooldown values when attacking.

Case #5: M5 - Test tower can be bought after combat
        We have three towers (charmander, squirtle, and bulbasaur). We call the startWave() method and test if the buttons to buy new towers are still clickable.

Case #6: M5 - Test start button disappears and reappears after combat
        We call the startWave() method and then check after a certain time has passed if the start button can still be pressed.

Case #7: M5 - Test tower range is the same
        We have three towers (charmander, squirtle, and bulbasaur). We use assertEquals() to check that the range property of the towers are the same.

Case #8: M5 - Test if rattata is killed
        We test if rattata is not visible by calling the removeEnemy() function (killed by tower). We then use assertEquals() to check if the visibility of rattata is false.

Case #9: M5 - Test if haunter is killed
        We test if haunter is not visible by calling the removeEnemy() function (killed by tower). We then use assertEquals() to check if the visibility of haunter is false.

Case #10: M5 - Test if grimer is killed
        We test if grimer is not visible by calling the removeEnemy() function (killed by tower). We then use assertEquals() to check if the visibility of grimer is false.
